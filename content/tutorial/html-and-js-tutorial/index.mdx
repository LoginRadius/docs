# HTML and JS Tutorial

**HTML** is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. JavaScript is a programming language, it enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.

This demo will help you with a quick implementation of the LoginRadius platform with HTML and JS demo.


> <a href="https://accounts.loginradius.com/auth.aspx?return_url=https://dashboard.loginradius.com/login&action=register" target="_blank">Create an account</a> to get started if you don't have one yet!

When you signed up for the LoginRadius account, it created an app for you. This app is linked to a ready to use web page - <a href="https://www.loginradius.com/docs/developer/concepts/idx" target="_blank">Auth Page (IDX)</a>.

Auth Page (IDX) reflects the configuration changes that you make in <a href="https://dashboard.loginradius.com/getting-started" target="_blank">LoginRadius Dashboard</a>. You can utilize this webpage for authentication requirements on your HTML application.

## Set Up HTML Project 

> **Prerequisites :** <li> The web server needs to be set up. Refer the guides <a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/setup-local-web-server-all-platforms/" target="_blank">here</a> to set up web server locally. You can also set up a small GitHub webserver <a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/setup-local-web-server-all-platforms/" target="_blank">here</a>.<li> Basic knowledge of HTML and JS.

- Download our HTML and JS demo project from Github <a href="https://github.com/LoginRadius/demo" target="_blank">here</a>, and put it in the root directory of your server.

- Open the `option.js` file and add the following:
  * LoginRadius API Key as obtained from [Get Cedentials](#get-credentials) step.
  * LoginRadius App Name as obtained from [Get Cedentials](#get-credentials) step.
  * SOTT as generated in [Get Cedentials](#get-credentials) step.

```
var commonOptions = {};
commonOptions.apiKey = "<LoginRadius API Key>";
commonOptions.appName = "<LoginRadius Site Name>";
commonOptions.hashTemplate= true;
commonOptions.sott ="<Sott>";
commonOptions.verificationUrl = window.location;//Change as per requirement

var LRObject= new LoginRadiusV2(commonOptions);

```
- After configuring the above options, go to your web browser and type in the root directory URL that your server is hosting.
- Now, you can start the demo and play with the available features in it.
