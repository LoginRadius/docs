---

>**Disclaimer:** This library is meant to help you with a quick implementation of the LoginRadius platform and also to serve as a reference point for the LoginRadius API. Keep in mind that it is an open source library, which means you are free to download and customize the library functions based on your specific application needs.

LoginRadius Combined Node SDK features a combined SDK set to encompass Social Login, User Registration.


This document contains information and examples regarding the LoginRadius Python SDK. It provides guidance for working with social authentication, user profile data, and auth implementation with a variety of social networks such as Facebook, Google, Twitter. You can get the SDK from [here](https://github.com/LoginRadius/python-sdk) 

## Installation

### Install From Package

Using `pip`

```
 pip install loginradius-v2==10.0.1

```

or with easy_install:

```
  easy_install loginradius-v2==10.0.1
```

### Install From Source

You can download the latest version from PyPI

- Unzip/untar the files.
- Browse to the directory that you extracted the files to.
- Run python setup.py install to install the LoginRadius module.

### Requests library
To call API's, install requests library.

Using pip

```
 pip install requests
```

or with easy_install
```
 easy_install requests
```


## Configuration

#### Initialize SDK

Import the class

```python
 from LoginRadius import LoginRadius as LR
```

- When your Python application initializes, set your API Key and Secret:

```python
  LR.API_KEY = "<API-KEY>"
  LR.API_SECRET = "<API-SECRET>"
  loginradius = LR()
```
- To enable API request signing, set the value of 'API_REQUEST_SIGNING' to True

Create login_radius.rb in /config/initializers:

```python
  LR.API_REQUEST_SIGNING = True
```
