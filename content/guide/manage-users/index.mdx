  * **Created Time (UTC)**: The date and time of your user's account creation.

  * **Recent Activity (UTC)**: The date and time of your user's most recent activity recorded on your application.

  * **Action**: The options that you can perform on your user. You can reset their password, block their account, or delete their account. For more details, refer to the [Supported Actions](#supported-actions) section of this document.
