  In your active user table, you will find the following details for each registered active user:

  * **Profile**: The basic data that identifies your registered user: Name, UID, Email, and Phone (if available).

  * **Provider**: How your user's account has been created: Login Method (Email or Phone), or Social Provider (Facebook, Google, etc.)

  * **Created Time (UTC)**: The date and time of your user's account creation.

  * **Recent Activity (UTC)**: The date and time of your user's most recent activity recorded on your application.

  * **Action**: The options that you can perform on your user. You can reset their password, block their account, or delete their account. For more details, refer to the [Supported Actions](#supported-actions) section of this document.
