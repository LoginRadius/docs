  In the log, you will find the following details for each log entry:

  * **Expiry Date**: Shows current expiry date (if applicable), or a change in expiry date compared to the previous log entry.

  * **Activities**: Detailing what has changed to the app status compared to the previous log entry (eg. if app plan has been upgraded, changes to Billing Cycle,...)

  * **Created By**: The one who made the change (Owner, Support Team,...)

  * **Created Time (UTC)**: The date and time of the change.
