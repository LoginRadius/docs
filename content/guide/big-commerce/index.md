## Stencil Theme Setup

It is recommended that you backup your theme before making any modifications if you would like to revert the changes at some point.

1. Install the Stencil plugin and the other dependencies. For detailed information, refer to this [document](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/installing-stencil-cli/installing-stencil).

2. Obtain the Store API credentials and download a copy of your existing Stencil theme to your local drive. Refer to [this document](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/installing-stencil-cli/live-previewing-a-theme)

3. Download and unzip the [LoginRadius BigCommerce-Stencil-Package](https://github.com/LoginRadius/bigcommerce-identity-plugin)

## Modifying Your Stencil Theme

1. Copy the contents of the **assets** folder from the LoginRadius theme into your theme's assets folder.

2. Copy the contents of the **components** folder from the LoginRadius theme into your theme's **templates > components** folder.

3. Open the `config.js` in your **theme > assets > loginradius >assets > js** and update the LoginRadius options object with the following:

   * `storeName`: Add your BigCommerce Site Name. This should be a string in the API PATH when your BigCommerce ACCESS TOKEN, CLIENT ID, and CLIENT SECRET was generated. E.g. - if your API PATH is `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/pqshk245fh/v3/`  , then your store name value should be `pqshk245fh`

   * `option.apiKey`: Add your LoginRadius [API Key](#get-credentials).
   * `option.appName`: Add your LoginRadius [App Name](#get-credentials).
   * `option.sott`: Add a valid LoginRadius [Sott](https://www.loginradius.com/docs/developer/concepts/sott).
   * `option.verificationUrl`: You can leave this default unless you want to direct users to a specific location to validate the emails. This is required if you are using the Email add/remove the panel. You can add additional parameters to this options object if you want to include additional LoginRadius features or logic based on the parameters list here.
   * `option.askEmailForUnverifiedProfileAlways`: You can leave this `true` if you want consumers to verify their email id. Change it to `false` for consumers to proceed without email verification. 

   * Add the following schema next to the `var LRObject= new LoginRadiusV2(option);`

   
     ```
     LRObject.registrationFormSchema = [
         {
         "Checked": true,
         "DataSource": null,
         "Parent": null,
         "ParentDataSource": null,
         "display": "First Name",
         "name": "firstname",
         "options": null,
         "permission": "w",
         "rules": "required",
         "type": "string"
         },
         {
         "Checked": true,
         "DataSource": null,
         "Parent": null,
         "ParentDataSource": null,
         "display": "Last Name",
         "name": "lastname",
         "options": null,
         "permission": "w",
         "rules": "required",
         "type": "string"
         },
         {
         "Checked": true,
         "DataSource": null,
         "Parent": null,
         "ParentDataSource": null,
         "display": "Email Id",
         "name": "emailid",
         "options": null,
         "permission": "w",
         "rules": "valid_email",
         "type": "string"
         },
         {
         "Checked": true,
         "DataSource": null,
         "Parent": null,
         "ParentDataSource": null,
         "display": "Password",
         "name": "password",
         "options": null,
         "permission": "w",
         "rules": "min_length[6]|max_length[32]|required",
         "type": "password"
         }
      ]
```

4. Include the reference files for LoginRadius in your header section by including the following code in your **theme > templates > components > common > header.html** just before the closing tag:

```
{{> components/loginradius/LRreferences }}
```

5. If you are using Single Sign-On, include the tag:

```
{{> components/loginradius/LRsso }}
```

6. Go to the theme and open the `create-account.html` file in your **theme > templates > pages > auth > create-account.html** and replace the existing complete create-account form code with:
 
 ```
 {{inject 'passwordRequirements' settings.password_requirements}}
 {{#partial "page"}}
 {{> components/common/breadcrumbs breadcrumbs=breadcrumbs}}
 <h1 class="page-heading">{{lang 'create_account.heading' }}</h1>

 <div class="account account--fixed">
 {{> components/loginradius/register }} 
 </div>
 {{/partial}}
 {{> layout/base}}

 ```

7. Open the `login.html` file in your **theme >templates > pages > auth > login.html** and replace the existing Login Form interface 'div' code with

```
{{> components/loginradius/auth }}
```

![alt_text](images/bigcommerce-code.png "image_tooltip")

This will display the pre-styled User authentication features which include handling of Login, Social Login, Registration, Forgot Password, and Reset Password.

8. If you are using SSO you will need to handle the Logout functionality by opening the `navigation.html` file in your **theme > templates > components > common** and change the logout link to:

```
<a class="navUser-action" onclick="lrLogout(); return false;" href="#">{{lang 'common.logout'}}</a>
```

9. If you are using the optimized one-page checkout, you will need to include the following component on your `checkout.html` page file in your **theme > templates > pages** after the partial page handlebars:

```
{{#partial "page"}}

 {{> components/loginradius/LoginRadiusOptimizedCheckout }}
 
 ```
> **Note:** To see the live preview of the changes you have made to your stencil theme, refer to this [document](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/installing-stencil-cli/live-previewing-a-theme#serving-a-live-preview).

## Blueprint Theme Setup

The following sections presume you have a standard BigCommerce Blueprint custom template (Classic Next) configured on your WebDav, If you need assistance in setting this up contact the LoginRadius support team.

It is recommended that you backup your theme before making any modifications in case you would like to revert the changes at some point.

1. Open **WebDav** Access to your BigCommerce Site.

2. Unzip the **LoginRadius BigCommerce-blueprint-Package**

3. Copy the following folders to the specified locations in your **webdav/template** folder

   * **assets/js**- Copy the loginradius folder to your **webdav/template/js** folder

   * **assets/images**- Copy the loginradius folder to your **webdav/template/images** folder

   * **assets/css**- Copy the loginradius folder to your **webdav/template/Styles** folder

4. Copy the contents of the **panels** folder to the **webdav/Panels** Folder

## Modifying your BluePrint Theme

1. Open the `config.js` in the provided `BlueprintThemeFile\assets\js\loginradius` and update the LoginRadius options object with the following:

   * `storeName` - Add your BigCommerce Site Name. This should be a string in the API PATH when your BigCommerce ACCESS TOKEN, CLIENT ID, and CLIENT SECRET was generated. E.g. - if your API PATH is `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/pqshk245fh/v3/`, then your storeName value should be `pqshk245fh`

   * `option.apiKey` - Add your LoginRadius [API Key](#get-credentials)

   * `option.appName` - Add your LoginRadius [App Name](#get-credentials)

   * `option.sott` - Add a valid LoginRadius [Sott](https://www.loginradius.com/docs/developer/concepts/sott)

   * `option.verificationUrl` - You can leave this default unless you want to direct customers to a specific location to validate the emails. This is required if you are using the Email add/remove panel. You can add additional parameters to this options object if you want to include additional LoginRadius features or logic based on the parameters list <a href="https://www.loginradius.com/docs/developer/references/javascript-library/getting-started" target="_blank">here</a>.

2. Include the reference files for LoginRadius in your header section by including the following code in your `webdav/Panels/header.html` or `webdav/Panels/HTMLHead.html` just before the closing `</header>` tag

```
%%Panel.lrreferences%%
```

3. If you are using Single Sign-On also include the tag after the lrreferences tag

```
%%Panel.lrsso%%
```

4. Open the `LoginForm.html` file in your `webdav/Panels/LoginForm.html` and replace the existing Login page code with

```
%%Panel.lrauth%%
```

This will display the pre-styled customer authentication features which include handling of Login, Social Login, Registration, Forgot Password, and Reset Password.

5. Logout is handled automatically in the `lrsso.html` panel. If you have custom logout links on any of your pages you can add the following on click action to them to tie into the normal LoginRadius Logout procedures.

```
lrLogout(); return false;
```

6. You will need to update any of the dynamically created checkout page links if you are using the streamlined cart flow.

   * Search your template files for `%%GLOBAL_CheckoutLink%%`

   * Add the following onclick handler to these links: `onclick="assignCheckout(this)"`

>**Note:** Guest checkout is not supported by BigCommerce for Customized Login Providers

## Additional Theme options

The above steps will allow you to get quickly setup and all of the interfaces can be directly customized using the CSS, js, and HTML that comes in the BluePrint Package. We have also included some more basic functions to display the interfaces that you can use to customize the look and feel or to embed specific interfaces directly on your preexisting forms.

The following options are available to render specific interfaces:

1. `%%Panel.lrauth%%` - Displays the full LoginRadius interface.
2. `%%Panel.lrlogin%%` - Displays the Traditional Login interface.
3. `%%Panel.lrsocial%%` - Displays the Social Login interface.
4. `%%Panel.lrregister%%` - Displays the Traditional Registration interface.
5. `%%Panel.lrverify%%` - Includes the code to handle the email verification process.

10. `%%Panel.lrprofileeditor%%` - Displays the Profile Editor Form


## Storage of BigCommerce customer_id

BigCommerce uses the field `customer_id` to identify unique users for your store. In LoginRadius cloud, this is stored in the ExternalIds field of your consumer profile:

```
"ExternalIds": [
 {
 "Source": "BigCommerce-mystore",
 "SourceId": "6"
 }
 ]
```

The LoginRadius mapping of BigCommerce `customer_id` to ExternalIds also supports the configuration of multiple BigCommerce stores:

```
"ExternalIds": [
 {
 "Source": "BigCommerce-myfirststore",
 "SourceId": "6"
 },
 {
 "Source": "BigCommerce-mysecondstore",
 "SourceId": "21"
 }
 ]
``` 
## Additional Considerations

1. If you are including the email manage component or account details component on your account details page, You will need to provide a standard email verification page that all email verifications will be redirected to. This page should be accessible by logged-in and logged-out users and should include the verify component.

2. If you are using a customizable Checkout Page, you can directly include the auth component and apply custom styling to bring this in line with your Checkout page branding.

3. If you want to display user profile details such as a user's first name or other data stored in LoginRadius directly from the LoginRadius session, you can utilize the LoginRadius HTML SDK to retrieve this data clientside and display it as required (See the documentation for [HTML/js SDK](/references/sdk/html5-sdk/) but please take care, if you are using V2JS then no need to use HTML SDK (See the documentation for [LoginRadius V2JS](/references/javascript-library/getting-started/).

4. If you are migrating users from an existing BigCommerce site and need to preserve the user's passwords. Reach out to the [LoginRadius Support Team](https://loginradiusassist.freshdesk.com/support/home) for details on how to configure this.

## Uninstall Process
If you have installed the LoginRadius BigCommerce App on your BigCommerce Site and have customized the Stencil Theme with the below steps, make sure you revert the following items:

1. Remove the Scripts, CSS, and Content included in **Stencil Theme Setup** Section.
2. Remove the LoginRadius component files from the **components**.
3. Revert any Customizations made to the **theme > templates > pages > auth > login.html**.
4. Revert any Customizations made to **theme > templates > components > common > header.html**.
5. Revert any Customizations made to embedded links and any other pages that you have added a LoginRadius Panel.
