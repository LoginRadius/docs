Use the following commands to manage the registration schema of your application.

## Step 1: Manage Registration Form Fields

You can add registration form fields by selecting from the [existing list](#a-select-from-the-list) or add a [custom field](#b-add-a-custom-field) based on the requirement.

Use the following commands to manage your registration form fields and custom fields:

### a. Select from the list

#### To get the existing list of registration form fields

```shell
$ lr get schema
+-----------+---------------+----------+---------+
|   NAME    |    DISPLAY    |   TYPE   | ENABLED |
+-----------+---------------+----------+---------+
| emailid   | Email Id      | email    | true    |
| country   | Country       | string   | false    |
| birthdate | Date of Birth | string   | false    |
| lastname  | Last Name     | string   | false    |
| firstname | First Name    | string   | false    |
| password  | Password      | password | true    |
+-----------+---------------+----------+---------+
```

#### To enable/disable field for your registration form fields

```shell

# To Enable the Field
lr set schema -f firstname --enable
`firstname` enabled successfully

# To Disable the Field
lr set schema -f firstname --disable
`firstname` disabled successfully
```

> **Note:** You cannot disable the Email and Password fields, as Email/Password Login is the default authentication method. For more information, refer to <a href="https://www.loginradius.com/docs/developer/guide/emailpassword-login" target="_blank">this document</a>.

#### To update other properties of your registration form fields

```shell
$ lr set schema -f country
? Enter Field Name: Country
? Optional? No
? Select field Type Option
? Enter Option in the below format:
key1,value1
key2,value2 [Enter 2 empty lines to finish]
? Enter Option in the below format:
key1,value1
key2,value2
india,India
...
? This field is not enabled in your registration schema, Do you want to enable it? Yes
`country` updated successfully
```

### b. Add a custom field

```shell
$ lr add custom-field -f City
City is successfully add as your customfields
You can now add the custom field in your registration schema using `lr set schema` command
```

> Once you enable the custom field you can add the same in your registration form fields either by [enabling it](#to-enabledisable-field-for-your-registration-form-fields) or by [updating the configuration](#to-update-other-properties-of-your-registration-form-fields).


**Use the following command to delete the custom field**:

```shell
$ lr delete custom-field
? Select the field you Want to delete from the list: City
? Are you Sure you want to delete this custom field? Yes
The field has been successfully deleted
```

## Step 2: Auth Page

The Auth Page(IDX) will display the enabled or added fields in the Register tab. You can go to your auth page using the below command:

```shell
$ lr demo
```
