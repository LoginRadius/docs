# Bruteforce Lockout

The Brute Force Lockout feature allows you to restrict account access based on failed login attempts. Once the limit of failed login attempts is reached, the customer will either get suspended for the configured period or prompted to complete an additional security step to log in.

2. Click the down arrow, the Brute Force Lockout screen will appear:
