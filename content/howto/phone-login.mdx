You can enable the **Phone Login** feature for your customers to register and log in using their phone number. After the registration, the customer must verify the phone number one time via a one-time password (OTP) to log in. The Phone Login feature is default enabled if you have a Developer Premium plan. The customer must set the account password (and fill in the required fields) during the registration. While login, the customer will need to enter the phone number/email id and password:

> Note: If you want to enable Login with OTP for customers i.e. the customer enters phone number and requests for an OTP to log into the account, use the Passwordless Login feature. For more details, refer to the [Passwordless Login](/howto/passwordless-login/).

For sending verification, number change, and password reset OTPs to customers, you must manage SMS Configurations (Provider and Settings), optionally you can also manage the content of these SMS Templates.

## SMS Templates

You can manage the content of SMS templates used for the Phone Login feature. 

Login to your LoginRadius Dashboard account, navigate to the Login Methods section, and click the Edit icon given next to the Phone login method, as highlighted in the screen below:

<div style="text-align:center">

</div>

The following are the default SMS templates provided by LoginRadius Identity Platform:


### Phone Verification
The Phone Verification SMS is sent to your customers when they first register from your site. This SMS will contain an OTP that the customers will need to verify their phone number.

### Phone Number Change
Phone Number Change SMS is sent to your customers when they change their registered phone number. This SMS will contain an OTP that the customers will need to verify their new phone number.

To use the phone number change functionality, you need to customize your IDX page using [Advanced Editor functionality](/howto/advanced-editor/) with below changes. 

Add below container to HTML under Profile Pages

```
<div id="updatephone-container"></div>
```

Add below script to Before Script under Profile Pages

```
var updatephone_options = {};
updatephone_options.container = "updatephone-container";
updatephone_options.onSuccess = function(response) {
// On Success
console.log(response);
};
updatephone_options.onError = function(response) {
// On Error
console.log(response);
};

LRObject.util.ready(function() {

LRObject.init("updatePhone",updatephone_options);


});

```

### Password Reset
Password Reset SMS is sent out to customers who request to reset their passwords. This SMS will contain an OTP that the customers will need to reset their password.

The following displays the available default SMS templates:

<div style="text-align:center">
