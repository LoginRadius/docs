Two-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security for the users' accounts. With this feature enabled, once the user enters their login credentials or proceeds with social login, they are sent an authentication code to complete the login. 

Two-Factor Authentication feature is available on an add-on basis, and you can either make it optional or required for the users as per your business requirement.

> Note: This feature will not work along with [Passwordless Login](/howto/manage-passwordless-login) so to use Two Factor Authentication, you need to disable Passwordless feature on your app.

Login to your [LoginRadius Dashboard](https://dashboard.loginradius.com/dashboard) account, from the left navigation panel, click the **Security** and then navigate to the **Two Factor Authentication** section.  Click the down arrow or anywhere within the section. The **Two Factor Authentication** screen will appear:
