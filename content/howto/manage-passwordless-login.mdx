You can enable the **Passwordless Login** feature for your registered customers to login without providing a password. An OTP/link is sent to the registered phone number/email address, and once the OTP/link is verified, the customer will be logged into the account.

> Note: In the case of Passwordless Login, the customer needs to register by providing a password. Later, the customer can log in using the password or OTP.

LoginRadius Identity Platform allows you to implement the Passwordless Login feature in the following ways:

- **With OTP via SMS**: A verification OTP is sent to the registered customer’s phone number, and the OTP verification will log the customer into the account.

- **With Link on Email**: A link is sent to the registered customer’s email address, and following the link will log the customer into the account.


The following screen displays the passwordless login buttons (with OTP):

For sending login OTP or Email Link, you must manage [Communication Settings](/howto/manage-communication-settings/) (Providers and Settings), optionally you can also manage the content of these SMS and Email Templates.

## Email and SMS Template

You can manage the content of the Email and SMS template used for the sending login link and OTP. 

Login to your [LoginRadius Dashboard](https://dev-dashboard.lrinternal.com/) account, from the left navigation panel, click the Configuration and then navigate to the Login Methods section. Click the Edit icon next to the Passwordless login method, as highlighted in the screen below:
