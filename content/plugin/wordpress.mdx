## Interfaces

Following are the user Interfaces provided by **LoginRadius WordPress CIAM**:

### Login Interface

It can be used from the login page created from the plugin's authentication tab in the WordPress admin panel. It can also be used from the page on which the admin has applied the shortcode for login i.e. **[ciam_login_form]**.

To auto-generate the registration page, navigate to **WordPress Admin Panel >CIAM >Authentication** and check **'Auto Generate User Registration'** under the User Registration tab.

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="../assets/wordpress/wp-login-interface.png" alt="wp-login-interface" />
</div>


### Registration Interface

It can be used from the Registration page created from the plugin's authentication tab in the WordPress Admin Panel. It can also be used from the page on which admin has applied the shortcode for registration i.e. **[ciam_registration_form]**.

To auto-generate the registration page, navigate to WordPress Admin Panel->CIAM->Authentication and check 'Auto Generate User Registration' under the User Registration section.


<div style="text-align:center">

</div>

### Forgot password Interface

It can be used from the forgot password page created from the plugin's authentication tab in the WordPress Admin Panel. It can also be used from the page on which the admin has applied the shortcode for forgot password i.e. **[ciam_forgot_form]**.

To auto-generate the registration page, navigate to WordPress **Admin Panel >CIAM >Authentication** and check **'Auto Generate User Registration'** under the User Registration section.

### Reset password Interface

It can be used from the Reset password page created from the plugin's authentication tab in the WordPress Admin Panel. It can also be used from the page on which the admin has applied the shortcode for Reset password i.e. **[ciam_password_form]**.

</div>

### Default WP Login Form

Default WP Login Form is used for admin purposes. If the admin wants to bypass the LoginRadius authentication services or doesn't require registering a customer at LoginRadius, it can be done using the **[ciam_wp_default_login]** shortcode. For this Admin needs to create a separate page and apply the given shortcode on it.

**For example:** We have created a new page by the name “**Default**” and applied **[ciam_wp_default_login]** shortcode on it. The follwoing displays the default WordPress login form:

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="../assets/wordpress/wp-default-form1.png" alt="wp-default-form1" />
</div>

<br/>

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="../assets/wordpress/wp-default-form2.png" alt="wp-default-form2" />
</div>


### Interface customization

To customize the design (layout, pop-up design, or interface element) of LoginRadius interfaces like Login, Register, Forgot Password, etc  you can use the theme’s CSS file for overriding the design.
