When you signed up for the LoginRadius account, it created an app for you. This app is linked to a ready to use web page - <a href="https://www.loginradius.com/docs/developer/concepts/idx" target="_blank">Auth Page (IDX)</a>.

Auth Page (IDX) reflects the configuration changes that you make in <a href="https://dashboard.loginradius.com/getting-started" target="_blank"> LoginRadius Dashboard</a>. You can utilize this webpage for authentication requirements on your application.
