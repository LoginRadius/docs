With the help of **<a href="https://github.com/LoginRadius/lr-cli/" target="_blank">LoginRadius CLI</a>** you can whitelist your domain using your terminal.

For security reasons, LoginRadius processes the API calls that are received from the whitelisted domains. Local domains (http://localhost and http://127.0.0.1) are whitelisted by default.

**To get the list of whitelisted domain**

```sh
$ lr get domain
1.http://localhost
2.http://127.0.0.1
3.loginradius.com
```

**To Add/Remove the whitelisted domain**

```sh
$ lr delete domain -d http://127.0.0.1
http://127.0.0.1 is now removed from whitelisted domain.

$ lr add domain -d htts://google.com
htts://google.com is now added as your whitelisted domain.
```
